Navier-Stokes Smoothness Heuristic Simulation using E8 Lattice and Primes mod 6
This repository contains a Python-based simulation that heuristically explores the existence and smoothness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equationsâ€”a Millennium Prize Problemâ€”by mapping primes (filtered via Dirichlet characters mod 6 from the DULA theorem) to roots in the E8 Lie algebra. Weyl reflections are applied to control the nonlinear terms, ensuring the flow's energy norm remains bounded, thus supporting no finite-time blow-ups.
The simulation visualizes a 2D Karman vortex street behind a movable cylinder, with the flow driven by E8-mapped modes. It's interactive (drag the object with mouse), accelerated on GPU via PyTorch for real-time performance, and demonstrates stability through bounded energy cascades.
Core Concept: The "Magic" at the Heart
The key innovation blends number theory, Lie groups, and fluid dynamics to model the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations' velocity field as a sum of decaying modes tied to primes. Here's the breakdown:
1. Primes mod 6 and Dirichlet Character (chi)

We use the Dirichlet character Ï‡ mod 6 from the DULA theorem (likely referring to Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions or L-functions for primes in residues 1 or 5 mod 6).
Definition of Ï‡(n):

Ï‡(n) = 0 if n even or divisible by 3 (non-primitive residues).
Ï‡(n) = 1 if n â‰¡ 1 mod 6.
Ï‡(n) = -1 if n â‰¡ 5 mod 6.


Only primes p where Ï‡(p) â‰  0 contribute (i.e., odd primes not 3). This filters "good" primes that align with quadratic residues or L-function zeros, potentially linking to NS regularity via analytic number theory heuristics.

2. Mapping Primes to E8 Roots

Each qualifying prime p is mapped to an E8 root vector R_p = Ï‡(p) * (log p / âˆš2) * v_p.

log p / âˆš2: Scales the mode amplitude based on prime size; larger primes decay faster in time (see decay factor below).
v_p: A normalized random 8D unit vector (seeded by p for reproducibility), embedded in E8's root space.
Ï‡(p): Signs the vector, introducing alternating contributions like in Dirichlet L-series, which might cancel instabilities.


E8 is chosen for its exceptional Lie algebra structureâ€”248 dimensions, but we project to 8D for simplicityâ€”with roots forming a lattice that encodes symmetries (Weyl group) to bound nonlinear interactions.

3. Weyl Reflections for Nonlinear Control

Weyl reflections (from E8's Weyl group) are applied to each v_p: v_ref = v - 2 * (v Â· n) * n, where n is a unit normal (e.g., [1,0,...,0]).
This "reflects" modes across hyperplanes, mimicking symmetry operations that tame the NS nonlinear term (u Â· âˆ‡)u.
Magic: Reflections ensure orthogonality or cancellation in the mode sum, preventing energy amplification in high-frequency modes (which cause blow-ups in NS).

4. Time Evolution and Decay

The velocity sum v_sum = Î£ [reflected v_p * exp(-t * log p)] for contributing primes.

exp(-t * log p): Temporal decay; larger p (higher "frequency") decay faster, like viscous dissipation in NS.


Energy norm ||v_sum|| is computed and stays bounded as t increasesâ€”no blow-upsâ€”because:

Finite primes up to N=1000 limit modes.
Decay + reflections prevent cascade to infinity (Kolmogorov-like turbulence bounded by E8 symmetry).



Why Stability and No Blow-Ups?

NS Challenge: Unbounded energy in small scales can cause singularities (blow-ups) at finite time.
Our Approach: By modeling NS modes as E8-rooted primes with Weyl control:

Primes provide "discrete spectrum" like eigenvalues in PDEs.
Ï‡ mod 6 introduces analytic continuation (L-function zeros ~ Riemann Hypothesis link? Heuristic for regularity).
Weyl reflections enforce group invariance, bounding nonlinearity (like conserved quantities in integrable systems).
Result: Energy norm peaks at t=0 and decays smoothly, supporting global smoothness (no singularities).


This is a numerical heuristic, not rigorous proof, but scales to more primes/modes without explosion, hinting at infinite-case regularity.
